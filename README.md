# blippy's blockingdead stat tracker
ok so this is my first time using github sorry if anything is super jank

this is a java program I wrote to help me track my stats in a game called blocking dead. 
it updates after each game so that you can see your latest headshot percentage, leaderboard rankings, blah blah

It's able to track any other player's stats too, the default is just set to my username until you change it.

It runs through your terminal/console so make sure you have at least java 8 and google chrome.
