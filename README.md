blippy's blockingdead stat tracker

ok so this is my first time using github sorry if anything is super jank

this is a java program I wrote to help me track my stats in a game called blocking dead. 
it updates after each game so that you can see your latest headshot percentage, leaderboard rankings, blah blah

It's able to track any other player's stats too, the default is just set to my username until you change it.

thats all, next step is to convert it to a gui-based output, then hopefully a full-fledged mod.
