# BlockingBlip
hi I'm blippy

I wrote this program to track my stats in a game called blocking dead
The most recent release version includes a batch file to easily run the program in your terminal

You need java 8 or higher, google chome (the newer the better), and... an internet connection
The goal is to eventually convert this to gui-based so you don't need to run it in the terminal
